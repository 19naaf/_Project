## Form validation

"The contact form has been validated in all its fields using a set of JavaScript functions that verify that no input is left empty. Additionally, the data must be filled out in the correct format as appropriate. Finally, the user's data will only be submitted once all fields have been validated successfully."

## Responsiveness Page

The main page (index.html) has been made responsive by means of the styles.css page (@media (max-width: 950px)), where the content adapts depending on the width of the screen.

## Using a .Json file from the backend to the frontend

The endpoint was utilized to retrieve data through an asynchronous function (fetch) in order to dynamically inject it into the required fields on the projects page (projects.html) using JavaScript and the DOM. (Document Object Model).

## BackLog

I would have liked to dedicate more time to the semantic aspect of HTML and CSS writing.
